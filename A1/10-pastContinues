Subjec + to be(past form) + ing ...



I was watching TV yesterday mornning.

You were reading newspaper last week.

They were checking their emails.

I wasn't talking on the phone last night.

It wasn't snowing.

They weren't sitting on the couch.

Were you eating ice cream?

Was he crying?

Were they working in the factory?

Why were you laughing?

What was he looking at?

How well were they painting?

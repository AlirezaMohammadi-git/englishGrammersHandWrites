    (Mine Yours His Hers Its Ours Theirs)



This black car is mine.

Is that yellow house yours?

My pen is blue but his is red.

We can see your green bag but not hers.

This white cat is mine and this food is its.

Thier brown clothes are expensive but ours are cheap.

I could repair my laptop but not theirs.
